					Honestly this week was mostly a review. I can re-iterate some stuff though.
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc">
					<li>
						<b>LocalStorage:</b> A key store that remains as a session in the users browser storage. Allows you to persist data between visits.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Const/let:</b> Been using these for a long time. Const prevents you from <i>assigning</i> to a variable again, though for arrays/objects you can still mutate the data within.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Mobile First:</b> It's easier to design for mobile and then adjust the design for larger resolutions than it is to design for large screens and attempt to scale down.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Users Attention:</b> User's attention spans are pretty small and the faster and easier to use your application is the more users will use it. Google noticed they lose 20% of users per half second longer the page takes to load.
					</li>
