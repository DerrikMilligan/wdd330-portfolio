				<p><b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b></p>
				<p>
          We met as a team and worked through the assignment. Again I wasn't the driver. The team worked together well on the assignment and we were able to make a fun little pokedex.
				</p>

				<p><b>What am I going to do next?</b></p>
				<p>
					Keep up on the week assignments.
				</p>

				<p><b>What are my blockers?</b></p>
				<p>
					Right now I feel like I'm caught up.
