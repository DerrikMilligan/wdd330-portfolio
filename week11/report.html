				<p><b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b></p>
				<p>
					We met as a team and worked through the assignment. I didn't drive but it was fun to learn a little about how the <span class="emphasis">json-server</span> package worked in the project.
				</p>

				<p><b>What am I going to do next?</b></p>
				<p>
					I'm working on my final project. Been making some good progess. I have the web API mapped out for the most part and have been working to integrate the color-picker.
				</p>

				<p><b>What are my blockers?</b></p>
				<p>
					Right now I feel like I'm caught up and doing well.
