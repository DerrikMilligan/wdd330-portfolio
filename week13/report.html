				<p><b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b></p>
				<p>
					This week I spent a lot of time finishing up my final project and getting my portfolio submitted. There were a lot of fun issues I ran into with my project, but in the end I overcame them and I'm really pleased with how it turned out.
				</p>

				<p><b>What am I going to do next?</b></p>
				<p>
					Now the semester is over and I'll be moving on to my last couple classes next semester!
				</p>

				<p><b>What are my blockers?</b></p>
				<p>
					Right now I feel like I'm caught up and doing well.
