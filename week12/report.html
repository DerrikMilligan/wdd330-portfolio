				<p><b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b></p>
				<p>
					This week our team meeting was going over our finals. They had some good ideas for overcoming the <span class="emphasis">HTTPS</span> making a request to an <span class="emphasis">HTTP</span> site for me. The ColorMind API doesn't work through HTTPS, so I'm having to set up a small proxy on Heroku that will make the request for us and then just forward the response... Oh well at least that is working now.
				</p>

				<p><b>What am I going to do next?</b></p>
				<p>
					Now I need to get the <span class="emphasis">localStorage</span> set up so you can save colors you'd like to it. Then I need to expand the history so you can generate a few at a time without having to commit to saving one to your history.
				</p>

				<p><b>What are my blockers?</b></p>
				<p>
					Right now I feel like I'm caught up and doing well.
